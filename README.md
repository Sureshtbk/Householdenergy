Household Energy Consumption Prediction Project
Project Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict household energy consumption using historical data. The solution helps households optimize energy usage and assists energy providers in demand forecasting. Our Random Forest model achieves 92% prediction accuracy (R² score) by analyzing consumption patterns and key influencing factors.

Key Insights
Consumption Patterns:

25% higher consumption on weekdays vs weekends

Peak hours: 7-9 AM and 6-8 PM

Winter shows highest consumption due to heating

Top Predictive Features:
